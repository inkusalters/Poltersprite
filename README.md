Poltersprite is a simple ghost investigation game for the original Game Boy.
Explore a haunted house (and soon a haunted carnival!) and use your equipment to gather evidence and identify the ghost.
Make sure you get out alive! Find somewhere to hide if the ghost starts to hunt!

To fit the time constraints of the Game Jam, the game initially hosted 4 ghost types, 4 evidence types, and 1 location with 5 rooms. As of May 5th, the game contains 3 additional ghost types, 1 additional evidence type, and 1 new location with 8 unique rooms, as well as various new accessibility features (button prompts, popups warning of hunts rather than relying on audio cues, larger journal text), a complete rework of the inventory and journal, and (finally) a way to gain back some lost sanity for those struggling with the drop. You'll be able to use the truck computer to look at cat photos in your downtime to calm yourself and regain 20% sanity as many times as you may need to complete the job (15% in hard mode).

The game features a hard mode for added challenge, providing 2 evidence instead of 3, speeding up sanity drain, slowing the player, and speeding up the ghost. Additionally, 2 of the 3 hiding spots get blocked off, and sanity restoration is limited to 3 uses rather than normal mode's infinite uses.

The game has a point system and will display your score at the end of every game if you choose to view it. See if you can beat your friends' scores! Scores are not saved to the game and I don't plan on adding the feature, but you are welcome to do as you wish with the project file including making a leaderboard if you so wish.

The game also features hand-drawn sprites with original music and sfx, and with the newest update, comes with a printable foldable game manual to keep with you on the job as reference, like Game Boy games are intended to be played!

This is distributed as a Game Boy ROM. You may flash it to a cartridge or use any Gameboy emulator to play!
The project was created in GB Studio, with graphics created by hand in LibreSprite and Tiled.
The GB Studio project files are included as well, to open up modding.
