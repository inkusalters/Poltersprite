Poltersprite is a simple ghost investigation game for the original Gameboy.
Explore a haunted house and use your equipment to gather evidence and identify the ghost.
Make sure you get out alive! Find somewhere to hide if the ghost starts to hunt!

The game features a hard mode for added challenge, providing 2 evidence instead of 3, slowing the player, and speeding up the ghost. Additionally, 2 of the 3 hiding spots get blocked off.
As well as hand-drawn sprites and original music and sfx.

This is distributed as a Gameboy ROM. You may flash it to a cartridge or use any Gameboy emulator to play!
The project was created in GB Studio, with graphics created by hand in LibreSprite and Tiled.
The GB Studio project files are included as well, to open up modding.
