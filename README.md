# Poltersprite

**Inkus Alters 2024**

**Created for GitHub Game Off 2024 entry**

Poltersprite is a simple ghost investigation game for the original Gameboy.
Explore a haunted house and use your equipment to gather evidence and identify the ghost.
Make sure you get out alive! Find somewhere to hide if the ghost starts to hunt!

To fit the time constraints of the Game Jam, the game initially hosts 4 ghost types, 4 evidence types, and 1 location with 5 rooms. I am planning to include more content after the voting period ends to expand the game, with the potential for a new location if it is received well!

The game features a hard mode for added challenge, providing 2 evidence instead of 3, slowing the player, and speeding up the ghost. Additionally, 2 of the 3 hiding spots get blocked off.

The game has a point system and will display your score at the end of every game if you choose to view it. See if you can beat your friends' scores!

The game also features hand-drawn sprites with original music and sfx.

This is distributed as a Gameboy ROM. You may flash it to a cartridge or use any Gameboy emulator to play!
The project was created in GB Studio, with graphics created by hand in LibreSprite and Tiled.
The GB Studio project files are included as well, to open up modding.
